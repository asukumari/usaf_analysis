This program expects as input an image containing a single black/white edge.  It will:
1. determine the direction (horizontal/vertical) and sign (black then white or white then black) of the edge
2. measure the angle of the edge (for the analysis to be valid the angle should be close to but not exactly
    horizontal or vertical)
3. average along the edge (or a specified portion thereof) to reduce noise and allow pixel subsampling
4. take the gradient
5. compute the MTF or resolution by a couple of methods

NB a 3-channel colour image is assumed.  Pad grayscale images to be n x m x 3 to avoid wierd results...

    A non-directional first derivative of the image is taken (by applying
    first-order Gaussian filters along X and Y, then summing the squares
    of the results).  This should yield an image where the edge is a 
    bright line.  A straight line is fitted to these pixels, using the
    first and second moments of the intensity distribution.
    
    Later analysis functions expect the edge to be roughly horizontal 
    (i.e. image[i,:] should be a step function) and increasing (so the
    step function goes from black to white).  If the image should be 
    transposed or flipped, "vertical" or "falling" will be set to True,
    and the line returned will refer to the flipped/transposed image.
    
    Arguments:
        image: numpy.array
            a 2- or 3-dimensional numpy array representing the image.  Colour
            images are converted to grayscale.
        fuzz: float (optional, default 10)
            the smoothing parameter in pixels, used for edge detection.
        threshold: float (optional, default 0.3)
            a cut-off value applied to distinguish the edge from
            background noise, as a fraction of the maximum gradient value.
    
    Returns: (horizontal, line)
        vertical: bool
            Whether the line is closer to vertical than horizontal.  If so, later
            analysis will require the image to be transposed so the line is horizontal.
        falling: bool
            If the edge runs white-to-black as y is increased, we will need to flip
            the image along the y axis to ensure later functions are consistent.
